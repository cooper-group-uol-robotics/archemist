# ============ Workflow Recipe ============
#
# general: this section describes the recipe general details
#   name: the given recipe name
#   id: the recipe unique workflow id
#
# materials: recipe materials section
#   liquids: this section describes the liquids used in the recipe
#     name: liquid name
#     id: liquid unique workflow id
#   solids: this section describes the solids used in the recipe
#     name: solid name
#     id: solid unique workflow id
#
# process: this section describes the experiment process. The process
#             is represented using a finite state machine that is composed of
#             state and their transitions. Note that a workflow can have any 
#             number of states and their transitions.
#   state_name: name of the state
#   station: this section describes the station involved in this state
#     type: the station's class name as defined in archemist.stations.X.state
#           note that X stands for the stations's given module found in archemist's 
#           stations module
#     id: station unique workflow id
#     process: this section describes the station process involved in the state
#       type: station process class name as defined in archemist.stations.X.process
#             note that X stands for the stations's given module found in archemist's 
#             stations module
#       operations: a list that describe key station ops used in the process
#         name: name of the op that is going to be used as a key inside the process to retrieve
#               the operation parameters
#         op: class name of op to be executed as defined in archemist.stations.X.state
#               note that X stands for the stations's given module found in archemist's 
#               stations module
#         parameters: op parameters
#       args: any extra arguments needed to construct the process 
#   transitions: this section describes current state transitions
#     on_success: the new state the workflow will transition to in case the current state
#                 is executed successfully
#     on_success: the new state the workflow will transition to in case the current state
#                 execution fails. Use default the failed_state to indicate the recipe has
#                 completely failed
# note that the process is considered complete when it reaches the end_state so
# make sure your process terminates with the end_state
